## Hi there 👋, I'm Om 
I’m a first year undergraduate at IIT Roorkee with a strong interest in Decentralized web (web3).    
My work so far has been centered around JavaScript based development and C++, and I’m currently transitioning towards learning Solidity and smart contract development.

I’m particularly interested in blockchain and Web3 & fascinated by the growth of web3 these days.

I also participated in Syntax Error which gave me a hands on experience to the world of development through my team's project 

MOPS: Medical Onchain Patient System which is basically a website for  Decentralized Medical Records On the Blockchain.

Outside of tech, I enjoy being around people, **debating, acting, and communication** are areas I’m actively involved in.
